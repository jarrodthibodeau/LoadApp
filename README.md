# Load App
This project is part of the Udacity Android Kotlin Developer Nanodegree

This project demonstrates the following 
- Creating and animating custom views
- Creating notifications and their channels as well as setting actions to the,m
- Using MotionLayout to animate properties on a view

## What the app does
This app lets you select an item to download and download that item. Once that item is downloaded
you will receive a notification that will let you see the status of the downloaded item

## Notes
The Glide download takes a bit longer than anticipated so it takes a little longer for the notificaiton to show versus the LoadApp and Retrofit downloads
